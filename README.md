# Quick-Listen Spotify Web Application
A lightweight, simple Python-Flask based Web Application that makes use of Spotify's Free API to get the top 10 tracks and their details of Top Artists.
I have used Python library spotipy to interact with Spotify.

I Have hosted my Web Application on PythonAnywhere.com.
